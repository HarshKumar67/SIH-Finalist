# **Online Monitoring of Unauthorized Construction**  

## **Overview**  
This cutting-edge project harnesses the power of **Mask R-CNN** for precise detection and segmentation of unauthorized construction sites using drone imagery. By integrating **Geospatial Data Processing (GDP)**, **Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors**, and **3D modeling**, it ensures highly accurate area assessments and volumetric analysis, enhancing regulatory compliance and real-time monitoring.

## **How It Works**  

### **1. Detection & Segmentation via Mask R-CNN**  
The system utilizes a **Mask R-CNN** model trained on a custom dataset of drone-captured images to detect and segment unauthorized structures.  

#### **Steps for Area Detection:**  
- Extract segmented regions as binary masks.  
- Georeference these masks to align them with real-world spatial coordinates.  
- Convert pixel-based areas into **real-world measurements (square meters)** using **Geospatial Data Processing (GDP)** tools.

### **2. Validation with Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensors**  
ToF sensors are employed to measure depth and volumetric details, ensuring precise assessment of unauthorized structures.  

#### **Steps for Validation:**  
- **Depth Analysis:** Accurately measures structure height.  
- **Volumetric Estimation:** Ensures accurate 3D mapping for compliance verification.

### **3. 3D Modeling & Reconstruction**  
To enhance visualization and analysis, the system generates **3D models** of the detected structures. This aids in accurate spatial planning and law enforcement.  

#### **Steps for 3D Reconstruction:**  
- **Point Cloud Generation:** Using depth data from ToF sensors and stereo vision.  
- **Mesh Reconstruction:** Converts point cloud data into 3D mesh models.  
- **Texture Mapping:** Applies real-world textures for enhanced visualization.  
- **Export for Analysis:** Outputs 3D models in **.OBJ** or **.PLY** format for further inspection.
